    "Welcome to the Hardware Challenge! We hope you had fun learning about QAOA and AQO to solve the *Process Management Problem*. Now that you know thoroughly how the two algorithms work, it is time to device strategies to run it on real hardware. But beware! This is not an easy task. In fact, it is an open question. This challenge will put all yours skills as researchers to test. As we really want you to success, we will provide you with a lot of information. Your main task is not just programming a simulation but to thoroughly understand all the challenges that such a implementation pose. Are you ready for the challenge?"

    "Superconducting circuits are one of the most popular hardware platforms to implement these kind of computations. Their fundamental elements are Josephson junctions which are a sandwich of insulator-superconductor-insulator material. In the superconducting material, at low enough temperatures, Cooper pairs (two electrons bounded together) are formed. The Cooper pairs are able to pass through the insulated layer due to quantum tunneling effects, creating a current thatn cam be controlled through external parameters. \n",

    "For annealing with flux qubits we can control the qubit gap and its persistent current. This persistent current corresponds to a tiltable double-well potential, where the states in each well are associated with persistent currents that flow in opposite directions. The magnitude of the persistent current (PC) is associated with the strength of the $\\sigma^z$ term in the Hamiltonian, and the tunneling amplitude between the two wells is associated with the strength of the $\\sigma^x$ term in the Hamiltonian. In a typical anneal, flux qubits are initialized with a low barrier that yields large tunneling between the wells (transverse field), and towards the end of the anneal the barrier is raised and the double-well is tilted, which supresses the tunneling and give the qubit a net persistent current (longitudinal field).\n",

    "The flux qubit circuit is controlled via two flux biases denoted $\\varphi_x$ and $\\varphi_z$. For a given set of biases, we first find the two lowest eigenstates of the multi-level circuit Hamiltonian of the flux qubit, which we use to build the (two-level) qubit model. In the case of gate-based quantum computation using transmons, the low-energy eigenstates themselves are used as the computational basis, since the dispersive readout is a measurement in the energy eigenbasis. However, in QA we perform a persistent current measurement at the end of each anneal. \n",

However, the interaction term $H_{int}$ mixes the states inside the qubit subspaces with the higher excited states outside of it. Therefore, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation to find an effective Hamiltonian that acts on the qubit subspace.

Therefore, the computational cost of calculating the full-SW Pauli coefficients, which requires diagonalizing a matrix of dimension $q^Nc^M$, scales exponentially with the number of circuit elements, and can only be calculated for a handful of qubits and couplers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To target larger system sizes, [1] propose an approximation scheme where the system is divided into pairs of flux qubits that interact via a tunable coupler circuit. For each pair, the single qubit Pauli coefficients are calculated for non-interacting but loaded qubit circuits, and then the coefficients relating their interaction (two-qubit Pauli terms) are calculated via SW between those pairs only, neglecting other parts of the circuit. Let us consider a circuit of $N$ qubits and $M$  couplers, each with a truncation of $q$ and $c$ respectively. Using this approximate method, the cost of finding Pauli coefficients of single qubits if $Nq$ (each qubit Hamiltonian is diagonalized separately) which is linear in the number of qubits, and the cost of performing the full SW between pairs is $M(q^2c)$ (assuming each coupler interacts with two qubits) which is also linear in the number of couplers. This method is called pairwise-SW. It gives acceptable accuracy for the schedules while scaling linearly with the number of qubits and couplers in contrast to the exponential scaling of the full-SW. Instead of using the pairwise-SW method to calculate the coupling strength, one can use the Born-Oppenheimer method that uses a different approximation that scales linearly with the number of qubits and couplers as well but is slower by a prefactor. \n",

    "We discuss how to find appropriate circuit biases that yield a desired Ising schedule but the interesting problem is exactly the opposite. The circuit for each qubit and tunable coupler has two flux biases: $\\varphi_{x,k}$ and $\\varphi_{z,k}$, that thread their small ($x$) and large ($z$) loops respectively. Here the $x$ and $z$ notation is unrelated to the Pauli operator indices, and to distinguish the two we use a subscript for the loop index and a superscript for the Pauil operator index. The subscript $k$ indexes circuit elements, both the qubits and the couplers. Given a desired Pauli schedule, we wish to find appropriate circuit fluxes that yield that schedule, and we state the problem as \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\{h_k^x, h^z_k, J_{kl}\\} \\to \\{\\varphi_{x,k}, \\varphi_{z, k}\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we only consider $\\sigma^z \\otimes \\sigma^z$ couplings, since the typical design of quantum annealing circuits based on flux qubits can only yield strong interactions of this form and other types such as $\\sigma^x \\otimes \\sigma^x$ will be mostly negligible. Nevertheless, the methods we describe here are applicable, with mirror adjustments, to more recent flux qubit variants and coupling circuits that can implement other types of interactions such as $\\sigma^x \\otimes \\sigma^x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the circuit fluxes we use **numerical optimization**. For a given set of circuit biases, we can use the previously described method to find the corresponding Pauli coefficients for those biases. Therefore we can easily compare the resulting Pauli coefficients with the ones of our target custom schedule, and if differences are detected we can tune the biases iteratively until we achieve our desired schedule. In this way the biases are tuned by an optimization algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any given set of circuit biases we construct a convex cost function that calculates the difference between our desired Pauli coefficients and the ones that are calculated for those circuit biases as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}(\\{\\varphi_{x,k}, \\varphi_{z,k}\\}) = \\sum_{i} (S_i - \\tilde{S}_i)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\{\\varphi_{x,k}, \\varphi_{z,k}\\}$ indicates the set of all circuit biases, the summation is over all the qubits and all the different coefficients $S_i \\in \\{h_k^x, h_k^z, J_{kl}\\}$, and $\\tilde{S}_i$ is a similar notation for our desired Pauli coefficients, for which we wish to find appropriate circuit biases. This cost function is then minimized in an optimization routine to find the desired circuit biases. Note that although we construct a convex cost function, the optimization problem is not convex in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this optimization problem we apply a few constrains on the physics of the circuit which allow us to narrow the search region. There are three main physical constraints that we can impose in order to simplify the optimization task. The first is to note that the potential of the flux qubits and couplers is periodic with respect to circuit biases, and one needs to choose an *annealing cell* that fixes the bias ranges such that they belong to a chosen periodicity. The second is that the $z$- bias of qubit circuits cannot be tuned beyond a certain value; doing so will break the qubit definition for these circuits. Therefore one needs to place hard constraints on the qubit $z$-biases, which significantly narrows the search region. The third is that the coupler z-biases should all remain fixed at the coupler degeneracy point and do not need to be optimized. Tuning the coupler z-bias away from its degeneracy throws magnetic flux onto its neighboring qubits, which complicates the experimental control of the circuit. It amounts to introducing a correlation between the qubits’ and the couplers’ z-biases (this also makes numerical optimization more challenging). Additionally, keeping the couplers at their degeneracy point improves their coherence (by making them first-order insensitive to frequency fluctuations) and therefore improves the performance of the multi-qubit system, and will not adversely affect the achievable interaction strength between the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large variety of optimization algorithms and numerical packages that can be utilized for this problem depending on preference and performance. However, the computational cost of the optimization problem scales exponentially with the number of flux qubits and couplers due to use of the SW method for cost function calculations. Additionally, the cost function must be calculated multiple times for the optimization algorithm to converge to a minimum, which further increases the computational cost, making this method viable only for small circuits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the unfavorable computational scaling of the method and motivated by the pairwise SW method here an approximate method for finding circuit fluxes that yields the desired Pauli schedules is provided [1]. First, we use a numerical approach similar to the previous one to find the circuit biases for isolated but loaded qubits. With the qubit biases in hand, we then turn on the couplers and calculate the coupling strengths using the pairwise-SW method until we reach our desired coupling strength, for which we save the coupler bias that yielded the desired strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, for each isolated but loaded qubit circuit we construct a convex cost function that calculates the difference between the desired single qubit Pauli coefficients and the ones that are calculated the SW transformation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}_q (\\varphi_{x,k}, \\varphi_{z,k}) = (h_{k}^x - \\tilde{h}_k^x)^2 + (h_k^z-\\tilde{h}_{k}^z)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi_{x,k}$  and $\\varphi_{z,k}$ are circuit biases for the $k^{th}$ qubit only, $h_k^x$ and $h_z^z$ are the corresponding single qubit Pauli coefficients, and $\\tilde{h}_k^x$ and $\\tilde{h}_k^z$ are the desired single qubit Pauli coefficients. We use numerical optimization methods to find the circuit biases for all the qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we consider each coupler circuit and the two qubits that it couples as a joint system similar to the pairwise-SW method, and we fix the qubit biases to the ones that we found earlier using the numerical optimization method. Keeping the coupler’s $z$- bias at its degeneracy, we then turn on the coupler’s $x$-bias we calculate the $\\sigma^z \\otimes \\sigma^z$ interaction between the qubits (essentially creating a lookup table) and continue until we reach our desired interaction strength for that pair of qubits, for which we save the corresponding coupler $\\varphi_x$. Repeating this procedure for all the couplers, we can find all the coupler circuit $x$-biases that yield our desired two-qubit Pauli coefficients, while all the coupler $z$-biases are kept at degeneracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pairwise method gives approximate yet sufficiently accurate results, while scaling only linearly with the system size in comparison to the exponential scaling of the full-SW method. Now, we are ready to code."
